Cuomo said it was too early to rule on whether children could return for the next academic year in September.\\n\\nHe announced that 289 New Yorkers had died from COVID-19 in the last 24 hours, pushing the state\\'s confirmed death toll near 19,000, as infections continue to decline.\\n\\nMore than 700 people were dying a day at the peak of the state\\'s outbreak in early-to-mid April.\\n\\nCuomo said the number of hospitalizations was dropping every day and are currently in the 900s.\\n\\n\"That\\'s still too high a number,\" he said.\\n\\nSeveral US states are starting to ease lockdown measures, including Texas on Friday, but New York\\'s shutdown is due to run until at least May 15.\\n\\nCuomo said he would announce a few days before that date whether he would prolong it.\\n\\npdh/st'"
