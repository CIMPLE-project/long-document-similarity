0,1,"Schools in America's coronavirus epicenter of New York state will stay closed for the rest of the academic year, Governor Andrew Cuomo announced Friday."
0,2,The decision comes as the state remains cautious about reopening over fears that getting people back to work too soon could spark a surge of infections.
0,3,"""We don't think it's possible to (open schools)... in a way that would keep our children and students and educators safe,"" Cuomo told reporters."
0,4,"The confirmation came after Mayor Bill de Blasio said on April 11 that pupils would not return to New York City's 1,700 public schools this academic year."
0,5,"The Big Apple is the United States' largest public school district, with 1.1 million students."
0,6,"The city closed its public schools on March 15 as the deadly virus spread rapidly, pushing classes online and leaving families scrambling to arrange homeschooling."
0,7,Schools would normally end their final term in June. Cuomo said it was too early to rule on whether children could return for the next academic year in September.
0,8,"He announced that 289 New Yorkers had died from COVID-19 in the last 24 hours, pushing the state's confirmed death toll near 19,000, as infections continue to decline."

2,26,"Macron says EU virus package ‘advancing’, in talks with Dutch PM"
2,27,"French President Emmanuel Macron said talks on a EU coronavirus recovery fund were “advancing” Tuesday (23 June) as he met Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte, a key holdout against the plan."
2,28,"The Netherlands is one of the so-called “frugal four”, along with Austria, Denmark and Sweden, trying to rein in spending mainly for poorer southern European countries hardest hit by the pandemic."
2,29,Rutte welcomed Macron for a working dinner in The Hague ahead of a crucial EU summit on July 17-18 where leaders will try to seal a deal on the €750-billion recovery roadmap.
2,30,"Neither leader spoke to the media, but the French president tweeted ahead of the meeting that he and the Dutch premier “both believe in the solidarity which makes our Europe.”"
2,31,"“From now until the European Council in July, we have to convince our partners of this Franco-German agreement. The negotiations are advancing and everyone must be heard,” Macron added."
2,32,France and Germany came up with the outline for the rescue plan — a major departure for the normally spending-conscious Berlin — before it was fleshed out by the European Commission.
2,33,"Last Friday, Rutte raised doubts that EU leaders would reach a deal at a summit in July on the deal."
2,34,"“It is uncertain whether it would be finalised then or whether we would need more sessions, and whether they should be during the summer or later,” Rutte told reporters after a virtual summit of EU leaders last week"
2,35,"The four countries opposed to the deal say help should be given in the form of loans, not grants, with tough conditions attached."
3,36,Top Swiss court rejects climate activists’ appeal over tennis stunt
3,37,GENEVA: Switzerland’s highest court on Friday rejected an appeal by environmental activists who were sentenced for trespassing after invading a bank to play tennis dressed as Roger Federer.
3,38,The Federal Court dismissed the activists’ argument that their playful demonstration two and a half years ago was an emergency action justified by the climate crisis.
3,39,"“At the time of their action, there was no current and immediate danger,” according to the definition under Swiss law, the court said in a statement."
3,40,"In November 2018, the 12 activists entered a Credit Suisse branch in Lausanne to denounce Swiss tennis star Federer over his sponsorship deals with Switzerland’s second-biggest bank and its financing of fossil fuels."
3,41,"In January last year, a lower court acquitted the 12 defendants, accepting their “state of necessity” legal argument, finding that they had acted legitimately in the face of the climate emergency."
3,42,"But an appeals court reversed that verdict last September, heeding the view of the public prosecutor who urged judges to “practice law, not emotion,” according to Swiss news agency Keystone-ATS."
3,43,It found them guilty of “trespassing” — a ruling upheld by the Federal Court on Friday.
3,44,"The activists immediately announced that they intended to take their case to the European Court of Human Rights, in defense of their “fundamental rights,” including the right to free expression and to demonstrate peacefully."
3,45,"Laila Batou, a defense lawyer for one of the activists, slammed the decision and the court’s “lack of ambition,” according to Keystone-ATS."
3,46,"“The Federal Court could have given a clear signal recognizing that global warming constitutes an imminent danger, but also that, in some situations, civil disobedience is necessary,” she told the news agency."
3,47,"Instead, she said, the court “has ruled in favor of the powerful, the big corporations who can continue business as usual to the detriment of young people.”"
4,48,Terrorism financing watchdog reinstates Iran sanctions
4,49,"A multinational financial watchdog reinstated sanctions against Iran on Friday, saying the Islamic republic has not taken sufficient measures against money laundering and the financing of terrorist groups."
4,50,"In a statement issued after a meeting in Paris, the 38-nation Financial Action Task Force (FATF) announced it was lifting a sanctions suspension it granted in 2016 to give Iran time to work on reforms."
4,51,"Given ""Iran's failure to enact the Palermo and Terrorist Financing Conventions in line with the FATF Standards, the FATF fully lifts the suspension of counter-measures,"" the body said, referring to the United Nation's 2001 convention against organised crime."
4,52,"It also called on FATF members and ""all jurisdictions to apply effective counter-measures."""
4,53,Iran is alone with North Korea on the agency's blacklist.
4,54,"Last month, an Iranian arbitration body gave its approval to an anti-money laundering bill seen as crucial to maintaining international trade and banking ties."
4,55,The government of President Hassan Rouhani said the laws were needed to meet demands set by the FATF.
4,56,The government is hoping to salvage banking and trade ties after the United States walked out of a landmark 2015 nuclear deal with Iran and reimposed crippling unilateral sanctions.
4,57,"The other parties to the deal -- Britain, France, Germany, China and Russia -- have sought to salvage the agreement and maintain trade with Iran, but have called on Tehran to meet the FATF requirements."
4,58,"The FATF said Friday that it would keep Iran on a ""high risk jurisdictions list,"" and will decide on next steps ""if Iran ratifies the Palermo and Terrorist Financing Conventions, in line with the FATF standards."""
4,59,"""Until Iran implements the measures required to address the deficiencies identified with respect to countering terrorism-financing... the FATF will remain concerned with the terrorist financing risk emanating from Iran and the threat this poses to the international financial system,"" it said."
5,60,England's Lawes out of Wales Six Nations clash
5,61,England suffered a blow ahead of their Six Nations clash with Wales on Saturday after Courtney Lawes was ruled out with a potentially tournament-ending injury.
5,62,"Lawes was set to continue at blindside flanker in Cardiff but suffered apectoral, or chest muscle, injury during training on Wednesday."
5,63,"""The first part of training yesterday (Wednesday) he slipped over and felt something in his pec,"" England coach Eddie Jones said after announcing his team on Thursday."
5,64,"""We weren't sure of the significance of the injury so he was scanned this morning at the first available time and unfortunately he's got a little bit of damage there and needs further diagnosis and checking."
5,65,"""That will be done over the next few days and then we will have a clearer picture of his further participation in the tournament."""
5,66,"The veteran Australian coach added: ""He's done some damage to the pecmuscle. Sometimes those can be rather serious and sometimes they can be not soserious -- we'll just have to wait and see until we get further information."""
5,67,"Northampton back-row Lawes' place in the team has been taken by MarkWilson, who returns after being dropped for the defending champions'second-round win over Italy."
5,68,"""Well, six (blindside flanker), when we play Courtney there, it's more of ajumping, running role,"" said Jones."
5,69,"""But normally if it's not Courtney we have more of a work-rate six, whichis Mark Wilson. So, a lot of a good defence, a lot of good clean-outs. He willbe a bit of a 'glue' player for the team."""
5,70,The only other change to England's XV is the recall of hooker Jamie Georgein place of Luke Cowan-Dickie.
5,71,But uncapped Leicester teenage back-row George Martin could make his England debut off the bench.

5,75,"""He's very much an old fashioned six -- good defensive ability, carries theball hard and is also a line-out option and with time he may mature to be ableto play lock as well,"" said Jones."
5,76,"Wales, who are due to name their team later on Thursday, would seal the Triple Crown and leave them on course for the Grand Slam."
5,77,"Jones said England, who suffered a shock loss at home to Scotland in their tournament opener, and Wales were under similar levels of pressure for the""make-or-break"" game."
5,78,"""They (England-Wales matches) are tight contests that go down to the wire, down to the last moment. We won one there in 2017 basically 'on the bell'."
5,79,"""And we had to win 'on the bell' at Twickenham last year so we're expectinga similar sort of game."
5,80,"""It's the sort of game you've got to win not once, but maybe two or threetimes. Wales will keep coming and keep coming. It will be a great contest."" "
6,81,Hungary's Orban Rejects EU Border Closure Criticism
6,82,Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban dismissed Friday criticism from Brussels over the EU member's selective closure of its borders to foreigners following a spike in coronavirus infection cases.
6,83,"The entry ban, due to remain in place for at least a month, exempts the Czech Republic, Poland, and Slovakia - countries of the so-called Visegrad group that often align on EU policy, especially on migration."
6,84,"Hungary -- which is often in Brussels' crosshairs -- says the border closure, announced suddenly last week and in force since Tuesday, seeks to end the import of the pandemic from abroad."
6,85,"""They (in Brussels) can say whatever they want, but, with all modesty, we will see them follow our policies in a few days,"" Orban said during an interview on public media."
6,86,"""Without implementing the Hungarian practice, they will not stand a chance of stopping the epidemic,"" said Orban."
6,87,"Top EU officials prefer a bloc-wide approach to travel restrictions and have formally addressed Budapest over the exemption, warning that discriminating among member states was a violation of the rules governing the EU's passport-free Schengen area."
6,88,"Hitting back, Orban said Friday that ""Brussels bureaucrats have to understand that there is a very close epidemiological cooperation between these four (Visegrad) countries""."
6,89,"The Hungarian closures have caused traffic tailbacks at the country's borders, while local media have reported some cases of police ignoring the new rules and letting through non-national passengers."
6,90,"Hungary's population of almost 10 million has been lightly affected by the coronavirus outbreak in comparison with other parts of Europe, reporting on Friday a total of 7,382 infections and 621 deaths."
6,91,"But since late August new infection numbers have spiked, with a daily record of 459 registered Friday."
7,92,Paris Saint-Germain warm up for Barcelona clash with narrow victory in Neymar absence
7,93,PARIS: Moise Kean struck the winning goal as a Paris Saint-Germain side missing the injured Neymar survived a scare to beat Nice 2-1 on Saturday and boost their Ligue 1 title hopes three days before facing Barcelona in the Champions League.
7,94,"Kean struck in the 76th minute for his 10th Ligue 1 goal since joining PSG on loan from Everton, handing Mauricio Pochettino's side the points after Julian Draxler's opener had been cancelled out by Rony Lopes at a freezing Parc des Princes."
7,95,"The result allowed the reigning champions to go provisionally top of the table on goal difference from Lille, who play Brest at home on Sunday. Lyon are two points back in third but can climb to the summit with a win at home to Montpellier later on Saturday."
7,96,"""Today in the circumstances I think we need to be happy. We are in the position we need to be in,"" Pochettino told Canal Plus."
7,97,"""I think we controlled the game and deserved the victory. We didn't play great but I think it was a very professional performance."""
7,98,"PSG are expected to be without Neymar for at least the next three weeks after the world's most expensive player came off with a groin injury in a midweek French Cup win at second-tier Caen, a huge blow ahead of the Champions League last 16, first leg in Barcelona on Tuesday."
7,99,"Angel di Maria will also be out for that game, and the Argentine watched the visit of Nice from the stands next to Marco Verratti, another key player on the injury list just now."
7,100,"PSG were knocked out of the Champions League in the last 16 in each of Neymar's first two seasons with the club, defeats against Real Madrid and Manchester United both coming after the Brazilian suffered an untimely injury."
7,101,"After reaching the final last season, the fear now is that another injury to their talisman could prove fatal to their hopes against Barcelona."
7,102,"""We are missing some important players but we have a squad in whom we can trust,"" insisted Pochettino."
7,103,"""It is always better when you have everyone available but of course we are going to try to win the game and there can be no excuses."""
7,104,"Pochettino handed starts to Kean and Mauro Icardi alongside Kylian Mbappe in attack against Nice, as PSG sported a pink and violet-coloured fourth kit with player names on the back in Mandarin to mark the Lunar New Year."
7,105,"The new look inspired the home side to go in front midway through the first half thanks to Draxler, who followed up to score after Icardi had turned Thilo Kehrer's cross onto the post, the German scoring on his first league start since October."
7,106,"However, a Nice side who have struggled badly for form this season drew level five minutes into the second half when Marquinhos attempted a pass out from the back but only succeeded in finding Lopes, who picked up the ball on the edge of the box and fired high into the net."
7,107,"Keylor Navas then turned Amine Gouiri's shot onto the bar with PSG on the ropes, but Pochettino's side grabbed the winner with just under quarter of an hour left."
7,108,"Mbappe's cross from the left to the back post was returned into the six-yard area by Icardi, and Kean headed in."

8,113,"A total of 20,089,551 people have received a first dose, according to government figures released Sunday."

8,115,"In mid-February, the UK met a government target of 15 million of the most vulnerable people receiving first doses."
8,116,The government says it plans to offer a first jab to the whole adult population by the end of July.
8,117,Only Israel and the United Arab Emirates have vaccinated more people per head of population.
8,118,"Smiling, Hancock said ""I want to thank every single person who has come forward to get the jab,"" calling this ""the route out of this for all of us."""
8,119,"""There's a long way to go but we're making big strides,"" he said."
8,120,"The UK's vaccination programme has rolled out fast since its start in early December, when it became the first country in the world to begin mass inoculation with a fully trialled vaccine."

8,125,"On Thursday, Britain lowered the country's virus alert level down one notch from the highest possible, saying the fall in cases had reduced the threat to the state-run National Health Service."

(Photo by Handout / ANONYMOUS / AFP)
9,128,"Anti-coup demonstrators in Myanmar decorated boiled eggs on Sunday, as Pope Francis in his Easter message expressed solidarity with the country's youth."
9,129,Myanmar has been gripped by turmoil since a Feb 1 coup ousted civilian leader Aung San Suu Kyi and derailed the country's tentative transition to democracy.
9,130,"Security forces have sought to quell a mass uprising with lethal force and the death toll reached 557 as of Saturday, according to local monitoring group Assistance Association for Political Prisoners (AAPP)."
9,131,"On Easter, decorated eggs became the latest emblem of resistance as scores of Myanmar protesters painted political messages on them and left them on neighbour's doorsteps."
9,132,"Pictures posted on social media showed eggs adorned with images of Suu Kyi and three-finger salutes -- a protest gesture -- while others said ""save our people"" and ""democracy""."

9,147,"""Can a company like Total decide to cut off the electricity supply to millions of people -- and in so doing, disrupt the operation of hospitals, businesses?"" he told the Journal du Dimanche."
9,148,"Pouyanne said he was ""outraged by the repression"" in Myanmar but would refuse to ""act to the detriment of our local employees and the Burmese population who are already suffering so much."""

9,151,"Total paid about $230 million to the Myanmar authorities in 2019 and $176 million in 2020 in taxes and ""production rights"", according to the company's financial statements."
9,152,"The company has not yet paid taxes -- worth around $4 million per month -- to the junta because the banking system has ceased to operate, Pouyanne said."

14,221,Estonia tests virus 'immunity passport' app
14,222,"Tech-savvy Estonia has developed an app that could serve as a kind of digital ""immunity passport"", allowing users with antibodies to show employers and others their reduced risk of spreading the coronavirus."
14,223,"The Baltic state is not the only country exploring the potential of such a passport, though global health authorities and experts urge caution, given concerns over the accuracy of antibody tests."
14,224,"The Immuunsuspass (ImmunityPassport) app, which is being tested out this month, was developed by the Estonian tech firms Transferwise and Guardtime in cooperation with health specialists for the Back to Work non-governmental organisation."
14,225,"""The app we've created can provide necessary data to schools and employers to help them make decisions,"" TransferWise cofounder Taavet Hinrikus told AFP."
14,226,"""However, before it's adopted for widespread use, we need to achieve a scientific consensus on COVID-19 immunity."""
14,227,The app allows users to access their COVID-19 test results for an hour after proving their identity. They can also share the results with others using a QR-code that expires after a minute.
14,228,The developers say this ensures that the immunity results are up-to-date and protected against unauthorised sharing.
14,229,"In the future, users will also be able to access their vaccination data."
14,230,"The World Health Organization issued a warning in late April that there was ""not enough evidence"" to give people ""risk-free certificates,"" but hours later appeared to backpedal with a modified statement."
14,231,"In the follow-up, WHO said it expected that people who are infected with COVID-19 ""will develop an antibody response that will provide some level of protection"" but added that ""what we don't yet know is the level of protection or how long it will last""."
14,232,Estonia—or E-stonia as it is sometimes dubbed—has made a name for itself as a trailblazer in technology over the years. It notably pioneered e-voting in 2005 and plays host to NATO's elite cyber defence centre.

15,234,US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said Wednesday he saw progress in reopening travel with the European Union shut by the coronavirus pandemic but offered no timeline.
15,235,"The European Union declined to include the United States, where COVID-19 cases are rising, in a safe list of nations whose nationals can visit the bloc."
15,236,"Pompeo said the United States and European Union were discussing ""procedures and protocols"" to put in place to resume travel."
15,237,"""We've made some real progress -- technical progress -- and now we need to draw that to a conclusion,"" Pompeo told a news conference."
15,238,"""And then there'll be a system -- a system to monitor and measure to make sure that we get the timing right,"" Pompeo said."
15,239,"""Both sides understand that our economies depend on it. The deep, important transatlantic relationship matters."""
15,240,"President Donald Trump in March also imposed a ban on most Europeans, initially drawing outrage before the continent took similar measures on its own."

16,243,"Two former US soldiers have been sentenced to 20 years in prison in Venezuela on charges including terrorism, after a failed bid to invade the Caribbean country last May, Attorney General Tarek William Saab said."
16,244,"Luke Alexander Denman, 34, and Airan Berry, 41, ""admitted"" to ""conspiracy, association (to commit crimes), illicit trafficking of war weapons and terrorism"" over the attempted invasion, allegedly aimed at toppling President Nicolas Maduro, Saab said on Twitter around midnight Friday.

17,249,When coronavirus robs you of your sense of smell
17,250,"""What I miss most is the smell of my son when I kiss him, the smell of my wife's body,"" says Jean-Michel Maillard."
17,251,"Anosmia -- the loss of one's sense of smell -- may be an invisible handicap, but is psychologically difficult to live with and has no real treatment, he says."
17,252,"And it is the price that an increasing number of people are paying after surviving a brush with the coronavirus, with some facing a seemingly long-term inability to smell."
17,253,"""Anosmia cuts you off from the smells of life, it's a torture,"" says Maillard, president of anosmie.org, a French group designed to help sufferers."
17,254,"If you have the condition you can no longer breathe in the smell of your first morning coffee, smell the cut grass of a freshly mown lawn or even ""the reassuring smell of soap on your skin when you're preparing for a meeting"", he says."
17,255,"You only truly become aware of your sense of smell when you lose it, says Maillard, who lost his own following an accident."
17,256,"And it is not just the olfactory pleasures you lose. He points out that people with anosmia are unable to smell smoke from a fire, gas from a leak, or a poorly washed dustbin."
17,257,"Eating is a completely different experience too, as so much of what we appreciate in food is what we can smell, says Alain Corre, an ear, nose and throat specialist at the Hopital-Fondation Rothschild in Paris."
17,258,"""There are dozens of causes of anosmia,"" he says, including nasal polyps, chronic rhinitis, diabetes, Alzheimer's and Parkinson's."
17,259,"Now the new coronavirus has been added to that list, says Corre -- with the symptom alone allowing a diagnosis of COVID-19 in some cases."
17,260,"""When people lose their sense of smell and don't get it back, we note a real change in the quality of life and a level of depression that is not insignificant,"" he adds."
17,261,"The problem is when the condition persists, he says."
17,262,"""To be deprived of your sense of smell for a month, it's not serious,"" says Maillard. ""Two months, it starts to become a problem. But after six months, you're all alone under a bell jar."
17,263,"""There's a psychological aspect to this which is very difficult to live with,"" he insists. ""You need to get help."""
17,264,- The search for treatment -
17,265,There is no specific treatment for the condition.
17,266,"You have to address the cause, says Corre, but ""the problem of the anosmias linked to the virus is that often, the treatment of the viral infection has no effect on your smell."
17,267,"""According to the first numbers, around 80 percent of patients suffering from COVID-19 recover spontaneously in less than a month and often even faster, in eight to 10 days."""
17,268,"For others, however, it could be that the disease has destroyed their olfactory neurons -- the ones that detect smells. The good news is that these neurons, at the back of the nose, are able to regenerate."
17,269,"Two Paris hospitals, Rothschild and Lariboisiere, have launched a ""CovidORL"" study to investigate the phenomenon, testing how well different nose washes can cure anosmia."
17,270,"One cortisone-based treatment has proved effective in treating post-cold instances of anosmia and offers some hope, says Corre."
17,271,"Another way to approach the condition is through olfactory re-education, to try to stimulate the associations that specific smells have in your memory, he says."
17,272,"His advice is to choose five smells in your kitchen that are special to you, that you really like: cinnamon say, or thyme. Breathe them in twice a day for five to 10 minutes while looking at what it is you are inhaling."
17,273,"Anosmie.org has even put together a re-education programme using essential oils, working with Hirac Gurden, director of neuroscience research at the National Centre for Scientific Research (CNRS). It is based on the work of Dresden-based researcher Thomas Hummel."
17,274,"""As early as March, we got several hundred phone calls, emails from people who had COVID and who were calling for help because they couldn't smell anything any more,"" says Gurden."
17,275,"Maillard meanwhile finished his re-education programme last winter, using four smells."
17,276,"""Today, I have 10 of them,"" he says, including fish, cigarettes and rose essential oil. ""I've even found a perfume that I can smell!"" he declares."
18,277,Swedish PM wants quick deal on EU recovery fund
18,278, Sweden's Prime Minister Stefan Lofven said Wednesday he hopes for a quick resolution of the disagreements over a proposed coronavirus economic recovery fund and EU long-term budget.
18,279,"But speaking at a joint press conference with Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez, Lofven said Sweden is still in favour of the recovery fund handing out aid as loans rather than grants, the main bone of contention."
18,280,"EU leaders are holding a two-day summit beginning Friday, and Lofven said Sweden aims to get a deal done."
18,281,"""We don't want this to drag on for too long, so we need to work hard, be constructive and negotiate as we should to reach an agreement,"" he said."
18,282,"""Having said that I don't know whether it's possible or not,"" Lofven added."
18,283,"Sanchez had travelled to meet with Lofven to try and assuage Sweden, which together with Austria, the Netherlands and Denmark, is opposed to the proposed 750 billion euro recovery fund handing out funds as grants rather than loans."
18,284,"""We need a recovery fund yes, it should be directed to the actual needs and be based on favourable loans and not grants,"" Lofven told reporters."
18,285,"Pedro Sanchez stressed that while they were heading into ""difficult negotiations"" they also were in agreement on several issues."
18,286,"""We have different views on how to respond commonly to this crisis, but we have also common goals,"" Sanchez said."
18,287,"On Tuesday, Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte said he was ""not hopeful"" of a deal on an EU coronavirus fund this week."
18,288,"The plan, backed in particular by Berlin and Paris, requires unanimous approval to be adopted."
18,289,"Lofven did not exclude a Swedish veto, but said there was a need to be constructive."
18,290,"""You don't go into a negotiation with that attitude, you go into a negotiation to try to find a solution,"" Lofven stressed."
19,291,"As Trump Returns To Political Stage, Questions About His 2024 Win Surface"
19,292,"A Trump 2024 announcement may not come at Conservative Political Action Conference, which starts Friday with panels on ""cancel culture"" and ""protecting elections."" "
19,293,Washington:
19,294,"Brace yourself for Donald Trump 2.0, America. The ex-president returns from political hiatus Sunday seeking to regain control of a Republican Party that is out of power and pondering whether the flawed billionaire can win again in 2024."
19,295,"After losing the Senate and White House, and failing to retake the House of Representatives, a US political party would normally lick its wounds, jettison its failed leader and chart a new path forward to claw back relevance."
19,296,"But Trump is a singular force who maintains a vice grip on the Republican base, and all eyes will be on the 74-year-old showman when he addresses the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) and teases attendees about his political future."
19,297,"The speech, his first post-presidential address, comes on CPAC's final day in Orlando, Florida where he is expected to be enthusiastically received at the nation's largest gathering of conservatives."
19,298,"But is he still the party's uncontested leader, despite losing to Joe Biden? Or is Trump a twice-impeached has-been who left Washington in shame, banned from Twitter and accused of inciting a January 6 insurrection at the US Capitol?"
19,299,"While Trump has largely kept to himself at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida, after spending months promoting the falsehood that the election was stolen, strategists and many lawmakers say he remains the dominant conservative political force."
19,300,"""President Trump is the leader of the Republican Party,"" congressman Jim Jordan declared Wednesday on Twitter."
19,301,"A source familiar with Trump's plans said the former president will be ""talking about the future of the Republican Party"" at CPAC and will criticize some of Biden's new policies."
19,302,"But a Trump 2024 announcement may not come at CPAC, which starts Friday with panels on ""cancel culture"" and ""protecting elections."""
19,303,"CPAC organizer Matt Schlapp, a pro-Trump activist, retweeted a reporter Wednesday citing sources saying that Trump will not announce his candidacy Sunday but will appear ""warm"" to the idea."
19,304,- Base 'still with Trump' -
19,305,"Such posturing will likely freeze other Republican contenders in place, for now at least."
19,306,"Several potential White House hopefuls -- including former secretary of state Mike Pompeo, South Dakota Governor Kristi Noem and Senator Josh Hawley -- will address CPAC, which may make for awkward presentations to a crowd still in Trump's thrall."
19,307,A mid-February Quinnipiac poll showed three of four Republicans want Trump to play a prominent role in the party.
19,308,"""I think there's a disconnect between the Washington DC Republican Party and where the base is -- and the base is still with Trump,"" lobbyist John Feehery, who worked in House Republican leadership for 15 years, told AFP."
19,309,"Tensions over Trump intensified Wednesday at a Republican press conference. Asked whether Trump should address CPAC, House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy said ""Yes he should."""
19,310,"The question then went to congresswoman Liz Cheney, the Republican conference chairwoman who voted to impeach Trump over the Capitol riot."
19,311,"""That's up to CPAC,"" Cheney said. But ""following January 6 I don't believe that he should be playing a role in the future of the party or the country."""
19,312,"McCarthy could not escape quickly enough: ""On that high note, thank you very much!"" he said, ending the conference."
19,313,The drama exposed the extraordinary faultline between establishment Republicans and pro-Trump populists.
19,314,"""Whether the GOP remains an uneasy alliance of those two factions, or splits apart... depends on a number of things that haven't happened yet,"" said Republican political consultant Whit Ayres, president of North Star Opinion Research."
19,315,"Predicting another Trump candidacy now would be ""rank speculation,"" Ayres said, and pointed to the ""mountain of financial and legal challenges"" Trump faces, including his tax returns and alleged hush-money payments before the 2016 election."
19,316,- 'Stay tuned' -
19,317,"Feehery too is unsure whether Trump will seek the nomination, rather than remaining a kingmaker."
19,318,"""I think he just wants to keep relevance, keep people talking about him,"" Feehery said. ""Speaking at CPAC helps him achieve that objective."""
19,319,"But Senator Lindsey Graham, a Trump ally, said supporting the ex-president will be crucial for their party to take back Congress in next year's midterm elections and gear up for 2024."
19,320,"""If we can get behind president Trump and follow his lead we will win in 2022,"" Graham told Fox News. ""If we argue with ourselves, we're going to lose."""
19,321,"Asked whether Trump runs in 2024, Graham deadpanned: ""Stay tuned."""
19,322,Politics professor John Pitney Jr of Claremont McKenna College is confident Trump will control the GOP into 2024 -- unless legal woes or other hurdles consume him.
19,323,"""Supporters of president Trump vastly outnumber his critics within the Republican Party,"" Pitney said, adding conservatives may not enter the 2024 race unless Trump is out."
19,324,"Listen to the latest songs, only on JioSaavn.com"
19,325,"""Republicans understand that breaking with Trump carries a political price within the Republican Party,"" he said. ""Most aren't willing to pay that price."""
